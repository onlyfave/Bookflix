## Customization

### Adding More Books
To add more books, update the `books` array in `script.js`:
```javascript
const books = [
  {
    title: "Book Title",
    author: "Author Name",
    genre: "Genre",
    cover: "path/to/image.jpg" // Add the image URL or local path
  },
  // Add more books here
];
```

### Changing the Color Scheme
To change the color scheme, update the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #FF0080; /* Vibrant pink */
  --secondary-color: #333; /* Dark gray */
  --background-color: #f4f4f4; /* Light gray */
  --text-color: #333; /* Dark text */
}

body.dark-mode {
  --primary-color: #FF0080; /* Keep the pink accent */
  --secondary-color: #1a1a1a; /* Darker gray */
  --background-color: #121212; /* Dark background */
  --text-color: #ffffff; /* White text */
}
```

### Replacing Placeholder Images
Replace the placeholder image URLs in the `books` array with actual book cover images. You can either:
- Use local images (store them in the `images/` folder and update the paths).
- Use external image URLs (ensure they are publicly accessible).
